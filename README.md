# SimpleSentimentAnalysis
The code is contained in the file SimpleSentimentAnalysis.py. 
The data is contained in two files "rt-polarity.neg" and "rt-polarity.pos".
As is obvious, these two files contain the set of positive and negative film reviews.
The sentences come from a movie review data set constructed by the authors of this paper:
Bo Pang and Lillian Lee: Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationship for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales, Proceedings of ACL 2005.

Dependencies:
Python 2.7 (Python 3 can be used too, with some tweak in the code).
NumPy, Sci-Kit Learn, NLTK.

Explore the code as it is very simple and tune the hyperparamters and perform regularization/smoothing the way you want. Enjoy!
